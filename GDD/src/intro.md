# Intro

Welcome to the AGDD (Agile Game Design Document) for our one-month community game dev project!

This doc uses **mdBook**, which lets us write and organize everything in simple Markdown (`.md`) files. Markdown is easy to read and write—use `#` for headings, `*` for lists, and triple backticks for code blocks.

**mdBook basics:**

- `mdbook serve` — Start a local web server to preview the book.  
- `mdbook build` — Generate the static site in the `book/` folder.  
- Edit or add `.md` files in the `src/` folder to update content.  

We’re using the **latest Unity LTS** for stability and compatibility. Let’s build something awesome together!
